# EEG Motor Decoding

This module implements deep learning pipelines for single-trial EEG motor execution and motor imagery decoding, integrating explainability techniques for model interpretation.

## Core Components

- Time–frequency and spatial–spectral representations (e.g., spectrogram-based inputs)
- Deep learning architectures (CNN3D, Separable Convolutions, CNN2D-LSTM, BiLSTM, Transformer)
- Explainability analysis (Grad-CAM) for spatiotemporal and spectral attribution

## Methodological Focus

- High-dimensional neural decoding
- Low-sample-size learning regimes
- Structured temporal dependencies
- Inter-subject variability handling
- Model interpretability in biomedical contexts

## Research Context

This project served as a methodological testbed for scalable neural signal modeling architectures, with the objective of generalizing toward multimodal biomedical representation learning systems.
