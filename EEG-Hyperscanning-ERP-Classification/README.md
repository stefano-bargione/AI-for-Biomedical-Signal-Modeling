# EEG Hyperscanning ERP Classification

This module implements machine learning and deep learning pipelines for single-trial decoding of socio-affective event-related potentials (ERPs), with a specific focus on the P300 component in interactive paradigms.

## Core Components

- Single-trial ERP extraction
- Time–frequency decomposition (theta and delta bands)
- Wavelet-based feature map construction
- Classical ML classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost)
- Deep learning architectures (CNN2D, CNN-LSTM, BiLSTM, Transformer)
- Explainability analysis (Grad-CAM)

## Methodological Focus

- Temporal modeling of ERP dynamics
- Spectral feature learning
- Inter-subject variability handling
- Condition generalization across dyadic interaction contexts
- High-dimensional structured biomedical signals

## Research Context

This project explores how event-related spectral dynamics underlying the P300 can be embedded into scalable machine learning architectures for socio-affective neural modeling.

It serves as a methodological bridge between task-specific ERP decoding and broader multimodal biomedical representation learning.
