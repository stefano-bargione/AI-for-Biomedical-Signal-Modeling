# AI for Biomedical Signal Modeling

This repository contains research-oriented implementations of machine learning and deep learning pipelines for high-dimensional brain signal modeling.

## Repository Structure

- **EEG-Motor-Decoding**  
  Single-trial motor execution and motor imagery classification.

- **EEG-Hyperscanning-ERP-Classification**  
  Single-trial ERP-based socio-affective neural modeling.

## Technical Focus

- Representation learning for structured neural signals
- Time–frequency and Spatial-Spectral modeling
- Explainable AI in biomedical contexts (i.e., GradCAM)
- Scalability toward large-scale biomedical architectures

## Research Direction

The overarching objective is to develop scalable AI architectures capable of modeling temporally structured, multimodal biomedical data under uncertainty.

This work represents a methodological bridge between localized neural decoding and foundation-level biomedical representation learning.
