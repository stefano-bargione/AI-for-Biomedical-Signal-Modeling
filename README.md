# AI for Biomedical Signal Modeling

This repository contains research-oriented implementations of machine learning and deep learning pipelines for high-dimensional neural signal modeling.

## Engineering Highlights

- End-to-end PyTorch training and evaluation pipelines  
- Structured EEG preprocessing workflows (MNE-based)  
- Hyperparameter optimization via Weights & Biases (W&B sweeps)  
- Reproducible experiment tracking and configuration management  
- Grad-CAM integration for model interpretability  

## Repository Structure

- **EEG-Motor-Decoding**  
  Single-trial motor execution and motor imagery classification.

- **EEG-Hyperscanning-ERP-Classification**  
  Single-trial ERP-based socio-affective neural modeling.

## Technical Focus

- Representation learning for structured neural signals  
- Time–frequency and spatial–spectral modeling  
- Explainable AI in biomedical contexts (Grad-CAM)  
- Robust validation under low-sample-size regimes  
- Scalability toward large-scale biomedical AI architectures  

## Research Direction

The overarching objective is to develop scalable AI architectures capable of modeling temporally structured, multimodal biomedical data under uncertainty, with a long-term focus on foundation-model approaches for health.

This work represents a methodological bridge between localized neural decoding and foundation-level biomedical representation learning.
